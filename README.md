# Epileptic Seizure Prediction using EEG Dataset
### BE Project

**Software Required:** Jupyter Notebook <br/>
**Language Used:** Python

In this era, the neurological disease is rapidly increasing worldwide. Also varieties of disease are
on rise. Increased demands on health care systems due to neurological disease have become a
major concern. Epileptic seizures occur due to disorder in brain functionality which can affect
patientâ€™s health.

This project aims to predict the epileptic seizure with maximum accuracy. 
There are two algorithms used to compare the accuracy of the model - LSTM & ANN.
LSTM gives Accuracy as 89% and ANN gives Accuracy as 97%. While the final product gives Accuracy as 99%.
There's an ALARM system as well which sends emails to specific people who are responsible for the patient.
