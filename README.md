# Epileptic Seizure Prediction using EEG Dataset
### BE Project

**Software Required:** Jupyter Notebook <br/>
**Language Used:** Python

In this era, neurological disease is rapidly increasing worldwide. Also, varieties of diseases are on rising. 
Increased demands on health care systems due to neurological disease have become a major concern. 
Epileptic seizures occur due to a disorder in brain functionality which can affect a patientâ€™s health.

This project aims to predict epileptic seizures with maximum accuracy. 
There are two algorithms used to compare the accuracy of the model - LSTM & ANN. 
LSTM gives an Accuracy of 89% and ANN gives Accuracy of 97%. While the final product gives an Accuracy of 99%. 
There's an ALARM system as well which sends emails to specific people who are responsible for the patient.
